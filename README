Dear colleagues,

my files are:  our.bib + our_rus.bib, tensor.bib, chem.bib, algebra.bib.

I will develop them using some personal criteria to keep them tidy and clean. 
You are welcome to add new items there, but try to follow the guidelines (version 2010-04-27):

1. Put items in the proper place of file (see year marks for our.bib and tensor.bib and topic marks for algebra.bib)
2. Keep the naming conventions: author-topic-year. 
   For our.bib, author is abbreviation of several authors (ost-, etc.)
   Please do not forget the minus sign before year. Keep everything in lowercase.
   Some exceptions are of course possible (most historical is Tucker).
   This is very important for me, since I do not use kbib and typeset them by hands!
3. No abstract field please. No publisher field for articles.
4. The doi field for articles and url field for techreports are welcome (mygost.bst supports them).
5. Please double-check that the article is really article, the preprint is techreport and the proceedings are inproceedings.

Thank you!
Dmitry Savostyanov


PS. Old our.bib is renamed to our_old.bib. Thank you for understanding.
